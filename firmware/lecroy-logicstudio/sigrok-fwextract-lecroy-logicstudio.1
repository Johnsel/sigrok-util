.SH "NAME"
sigrok\-fwextract\-lecroy\-logicstudio \- Extract LeCroy LogicStudio firmware
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B sigrok\-fwextract\-lecroy\-logicstudio [FILE]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This tool extracts firmware from the Windows software that ships with the LeCroy LogicStudio logic analyzer. It is called with the path to
.B LS16Lib.dll
as its only argument, e.g.:
.PP
.B "  $ sigrok-fwextract-lecroy-logicstudio /path/to/LogicStudio/LS16Lib.dll"
.PP
The program will then write two FPGA bitstream files to the current directory.
Copy these over to the location where libsigrok expects to find its firmware
files. By default this is
.BR /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware .
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with 0 on success, 1 on most failures.
